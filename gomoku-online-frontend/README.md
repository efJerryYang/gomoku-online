# Gomoku Online Frontend

This is the frontend part of the project.

Frontend is a `Vue.js` project, the built `dist` directory generated by `npm run build` can be loaded by web server like `nginx` (but there are bugs at the moment when packaging stone images), or you can use `npm` to run it locally as follows:

```sh
npm install  # Project setup
npm run dev  # Compile and hot-reload for development
```
